**Redox is a modern API for healthcare interoperability** that makes it easy for health tech innovators to build applications for healthcare providers. Most importantly, Redox aims to take the complexity out of healthcare integration by offering a secure platform that provides a modern, standardized API that can be used to communicate with a vast array of EHRs, medical devices, applications, and other healthcare data systems, regardless of those system’s connectivity requirements.

Once you’ve integrated to the Redox API, you’ll be able to use the same code to send or request data from any system connected to Redox, allowing for a simple and complete integration strategy for your application or service

```
*The Redox API: a single, consistent, modern API to access patient data at your healthcare partners, regardless of the data format, connectivity     requirements, or communication methods of the originating system

*A Dashboard to configure, troubleshoot, and understand the health of all your integrations

*A network of healthcare data systems and sources to connect to
```
